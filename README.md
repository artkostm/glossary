# glossary
To generate glossary from any english text with translation to russian.

A few simple steps to have fun:
1) Create API key: https://tech.yandex.com/keys/?service=dict (note that there is a limit: 10000 request per day)
2) In order to avoid unintentional key sharing, do as follows:
  export DICT_API_KEY=<api_key_value>
  If it doesn't work for you: in root project directory, just create file with name 'key' and place the api key into it.
3) Create a file with name 'text.txt' and copy&past your text that you want to be "glossaried".
4) Run script using sbt: sbt "runMain EntryPoint" (or in any other way you like).
5) After a few seconds you can see a file 'glossary.xlsx' with in the root directory.
